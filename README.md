# simple_flask_app
This is a simple flask app which uses orms(object relational mappings) which allows us to add users to a database via a simple front end user interface.
The user interface is created by using html and css(cascading style sheets)
The backend is done by using python's microframework FLASK and ORMS are created by using the flasksqlalchemy and sqlite3
I will eventually expand this project and make it more dynamic using javascript in the near future.
